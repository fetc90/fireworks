# F I R E W O R K S

A basic firework display built from a [blog](https://blog.betawave.io/a-software-engineers-guide-to-unity-and-ar-vr-development-part-1-c20ce973bf8e) by Nicholas Hirsch.  I built this in a day and it was my first time using Unity and C#.

#### Purpose of Project
* Familiarise myself with the layout of Unity and the terminology
* Call an object in Unity from the code
* Be able to answer how you debug something in Unity*
* Add features downloaded from the Asset store to rendered objects

This was a really fun start, if I were to continue I would like to add different firework effects, change the sky to night and change the cyclinders to reflect a more realistic image of a firework.

As the code was already provided, I have written a [post](https://medium.com/@fetc/unity-universe-40674d850652) about how objects in Unity react to instructions from a C# script.
